    """A container that may have a value in it.

    Maybe is a container that may or may not have a value. It uses a special
    sentinal value to track whether there is a value or not in the maybe.
    This makes it safe to use with falsy values like False and None.

    This class is meant to be transparent as much as possible, but also
    maximize chaining. To that end calls that are meant to return a specfic
    type will always do so if possible, or error.

    Duner methods that are not expected to return a specific type will return
    a value wrapped in another `Maybe`, for example:

    >>> Maybe(int)("0")
    Maybe(0)
    >>> Maybe(int)("foo")
    Maybe(EMPTY)

    An `as_maybe` function is provided to allow accessing type specific
    dunder methods in a Maybe() safe way.

    >>> Maybe(None).as_maybe(AsMaybe.INT)
    Maybe(EMPTY)
    >>> Maybe("0").as_maybe(AsMaybe.INT)
